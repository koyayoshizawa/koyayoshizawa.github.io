Thank you for visiting the homepage of Koya Yoshizawa. Currently, I have been tackling from the view of cell biology on a robustness and fragility of bipolar spindle assembly in non-diploid cells. I plan to complete my PhD course in March 2025 and am looking for a postdoctral position.

Research interests and keywords:
Intracellular phenomenon, mitosis, ploidy (both haploid and polyploid), mitotic spindle, centrosome, microtubule, and etc.
