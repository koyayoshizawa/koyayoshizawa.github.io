Thank you for visiting the homepage of Koya YOSHIZAWA. \
I'm a PhD student in the research group of Ryota UEHARA in Hokkaido University, Japan.
Currently, I have been tackling on a robustness and fragility of bipolar spindle assembly in non-diploid cells. I would complete my PhD course in March 2025 and I am looking for a postdoctral position.

Current research interests: \
intracellular phenomenon, ploidy (both haploid and polyploid), and mitotic spindle
