Thank you for visiting the homepage of Koya Yoshizawa. \
Currently, I have been tackling on a robustness and fragility of bipolar spindle assembly in non-diploid cells. I would complete my PhD course in March 2025 and I am looking for a postdoctral position.

Research interests and keywords: \
intracellular phenomenon, mitosis, ploidy (both haploid and polyploid), mitotic spindle, centrosome, microtubule, and etc.
