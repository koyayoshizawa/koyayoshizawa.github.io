Thank you for visiting the homepage of Koya YOSHIZAWA. \
I am a postdoctoral fellow in the research group of Ryota UEHARA at Hokkaido University, Japan.
Currently, I have been tackling on a robustness and fragility of bipolar spindle assembly in non-diploid cells.

Current research interests: \
intracellular phenomenon, ploidy (both haploid and polyploid), mitotic spindle, centrosomes, microtubules, mitotic motors, and statistical analysis.
